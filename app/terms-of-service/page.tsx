          This Terms of Service Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) governs your membership with Solheim Technologies (&quot;the Company,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) and outlines the benefits and obligations associated with your membership. By purchasing and utilizing a Solheim Technologies membership, you (&quot;Member,&quot; &quot;you,&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) agree to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className='mb-6'>
        <h2 className='text-2xl font-semibold mb-2'>SECTION 1 – MEMBERSHIP PLANS AND PRICING</h2>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          <strong>1.1 Types of Membership Plans:</strong> Solheim Technologies offers various tiered membership plans, each featuring a predetermined number of monthly service hours and associated benefits. The membership plans are categorized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul className='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>
          <li>Basic Membership: $499 per month, inclusive of 5 active service hours valued at $750.</li>
          <li>Premium Membership: $999 per month, inclusive of 10 active service hours valued at $1,500.</li>
          <li>Pro Membership: $1,999 per month, inclusive of 20 active service hours valued at $3,000.</li>
          <li>Elite Membership: $3,999 per month, inclusive of 40 active service hours valued at $6,000.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          <strong>1.2 Primary and Secondary Hours:</strong> Each membership plan includes a set number of guaranteed &quot;primary&quot; hours per month:
        </p>
        <ul className='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>
          <li>Basic Membership: 5 primary hours</li>
          <li>Premium Membership: 10 primary hours</li>
          <li>Pro Membership: 20 primary hours</li>
          <li>Elite Membership: 40 primary hours</li>
        </ul>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          <strong>1.3 Rollover and Secondary Hours:</strong> Any unused primary hours at the end of each month will automatically roll over into a reserve account, becoming &quot;secondary&quot; hours. These secondary hours can be used in future months if primary hours are exhausted.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          <strong>1.4 Hour Usage Priority:</strong> Primary hours are always used first and are prioritized across all client accounts. Once primary hours are exhausted for a given month, secondary hours will be used.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          <strong>1.5 Secondary Hour Retention and Forfeiture:</strong> Secondary hours do not expire as long as the membership remains active. However, to retain accrued secondary hours, members must maintain an active membership without interruption. If a membership is cancelled or terminated for any reason, all accrued secondary hours will be immediately forfeited without compensation.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          <strong>1.6 Payment and Refunds:</strong> Membership fees are non-refundable and will be billed monthly in advance. The membership fee secures your primary hours for the month, regardless of usage.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          <strong>1.7 Price Adjustments:</strong> Solheim Technologies reserves the right to modify the pricing, number of primary hours, and benefits of the membership plans, effective upon providing a 30-day written notice to existing members.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className='mb-6'>

        </p>
        <ul className='list-disc list-inside mb-4'>

        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          <strong>2.3 Communication Methods:</strong> Solheim Technologies utilizes synchronous communication tools such as email and video walkthroughs to provide efficient and effective service. These methods allow for clear communication and documentation of tasks and progress.
